* Implement REST endpoint to CREATE ATS Order Types:

      1.Expiration Date (required) - this must be a timestamp date
	Effective Date (required) - this must be a timestamp date
        ----------------------------------------------------------> No Timestamp, only date ????
      2.Lets say for IMID, if provided a special characters, how is the response gonna look like, error code, or msg?
      3.Same combination of AtsOrderType and IMID replaces the existing record.
	How should we do it?
      4.
