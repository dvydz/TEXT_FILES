For export files: Server side vs Client side is not consistent
1. Headers like created by and created on are separated by an empty line in client side export, while in Server side they are right on the next line. Plus, some of the headers are not included.
2. After headers, there is a 3 lines gap between the actual data and headers while in server side there is two lines.
3. In Client side export the file name doesn't have underscore between the name and date.
